**Introduction**

The Human Resources (HR) department is a cornerstone of any organization, responsible for recruiting, managing employee benefits, and maintaining a healthy work environment. This portfolio project delves into an HR dataset to unveil insights into the organizational employee structure and employee demographics. 

**Dataset:**
The project utilizes a fictional HR dataset obtained from Kaggle (Link: [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koluit/human-resource-data-set-the-company/download?datasetVersionNumber=538)]). This dataset serves as a realistic representation of HR data.

**Project Objectives:**
The primary objectives of this project include:

1. **Employee Distribution:** Analyzing the composition of the organization's workforce in terms of gender, active status, department, and office type.
   
2. **Salary and Compensation:** Exploring salary distribution among employees and examining the compensation structure.

**Data Cleaning:**
Data cleaning is a crucial step in this analysis. It involved formatting columns appropriately and creating new columns such as "active_status_2023" to calculate the current number of active employees as of 2023 and various other columns.

**Analytical Insights:**

**Dashboard and Visualization:**
The project incorporates an interactive dashboard created with Microsoft Power BI, allowing users to explore and interact with the data visually.

**Challenges and Limitations:**
No significant challenges or limitations were encountered during this analysis, as the focus was primarily on employee distribution and salary, and the dataset provided comprehensive information.

**Future Prospects:**
Future iterations of this project could explore additional aspects of the company, such as revenue, key performance indicators (KPIs), and departmental contributions to the overall success of the organization. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the company's operations and performance.
